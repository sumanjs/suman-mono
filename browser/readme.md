# This project contains the Suman global dependency for use in the browser

Instead of building all dependencies and subdependencies with Webpack, it's recommend that you simply
import the pre-built suman.js file for front-end testing.

```html
<script src="node_modules/suman-browser/dist/suman.js"></script>
```
