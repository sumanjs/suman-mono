remove usages of require, so as to avoid caching files that may change

//

 => give user choice as to use bash or zsh or whatever for suman-watch

//

create pool of bash workers beforehand? => can't set env and cwd after the fact?

//

async lib types => https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/async/index.d.ts#L112

//

suman --watch x --watch y

//

should not cause problems

//

only if the expected number of watched files in the worker does not match, should
we throw an error.

//

suman --watch x --exec=""
suman --watch . --exclude="" --include="" --exec=""
suman --watch-as-per="zam"

make sure watch path passed by user does not include a directory below the project

//

process.stdin should listen for rs for "restart", and this will restart the watcher.
process.stdin should listen for rr for "rerun", and this will rerun the most recent test.

//

// compile TS file to node

//

move the transpilation code to suman-utils, so that suman can reference it too?

//

support hooking into transpilation "hot"/live watch processes, so we don't have to transpile from scratch
in other words, hook into tsc -w

//


// => we don't need to use Poolio, we just need to have one worker on deck, so everytime we kill a worker,
we start another one, but we use the one on deck.

//

create bats test with bash
